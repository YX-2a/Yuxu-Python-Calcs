# Yuxu-Python-Calcs

This repo has most of my calculator projects including converters, this repo **isn't** sorted chronologically and these projects were done in different times with different experience level.

Not saying that im anywhere near mastery but i can admit i did get a bit better and a lot more comfortable with writing code over time.

This repo is going to get bigger over time when i will include other calculator or converter projects i made.
